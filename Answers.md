It is rendering the id of the empty div class and using it for react.js.

An advantage of using sematic UI is that it is already implemented CSS and design so no need to code the boxes. The cons is that you are limited to what you can change for the design.

So that addToCart could be called within the onclick. Once the function click is clicked then the number of the addCart increase, but the addToCart will only work if the onclick function is on.

Makes the code easier to read and also doesn't cause any confusion later on. Also if you plan on updating the types of props, then it is easier from pulling it from a data standpoint.
